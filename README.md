In my Third Year of Engineering, I had a subject called Data Science in which at the end of semester we were supposed to submit a project.
In which my team prepared, a Book Recommendation System which, we used the dataset from GOOD_READ_BOOKS. It consists approximately around 11128 books in the .csv file.
So using this we prepared a ML model and a showed the visualized data in Tableau.
